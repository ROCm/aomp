## Overview

<A NAME="Overview"></A>

AOMP is a scripted build of LLVM and supporting software.
It has support for OpenMP target offload on AMD GPUs.
Since AOMP is a clang/llvm compiler, it also supports GPU offloading with HIP, stdpar, CUDA, and OpenCL.
The source code used to build AOMP is the amd-staging branch of the
[llvm-project](https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project) repository used by AMD for llvm developments.

The bin directory of this repository contains the developer [README.md](bin/README.md)
and build scripts needed to download, build, and install AOMP from source.
In addition to the mirrored [llvm-project repository](https://github.com/ROCm/llvm-project),
AOMP uses a number of open-source ROCm components. The build scripts will download, build, and install all components needed for AOMP.

This from-source build is intended for developers. It is long, has many system prerequisites, and requires extensive resources.
If your goal is to test an advanced develpment compiler, we recommend that you install the latest development
release of the [AOMP debian or rpm package](https://github.com/ROCm/aomp/releases)
described in the [install page](docs/INSTALL.md).
