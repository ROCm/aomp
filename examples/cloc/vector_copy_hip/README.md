Example: cloc/vector_copy_hip
==============================

This example shows how to use the cloc.sh script to compile hip kernels in the file vector_copy.cu
to create an HSA Code Object (hsaco) file.
The source code in vector_copy.cpp uses the HIP host API to load and launch the kernel specifically
from the file named "vector_copy.hsaco".
This file contains the GPU isa and is created by the cloc.sh utility from the source code found in "vectory_copy.cu".

To compile and run this example, execute these commands:

```
  make
  ./vector_copy
```

The Makefile will generate and execute three commands to build the vector_copy binary
and the vector_copy.hsaco file.
Depending on your environment, the generated commands will be similar to these:
```
/usr/lib/aomp/bin/clang++ -c -std=c++11 -D__HIP_PLATFORM_HCC__ -o obj/vector_copy.o vector_copy.cpp
/usr/lib/aomp/bin/clang++ obj/vector_copy.o -L/usr/lib/aomp/lib -lamdhip64 -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib/aomp/lib -o vector_copy
/usr/lib/aomp/bin/cloc.sh -mcpu gfx900 vector_copy.cu

```
The first two commands compile and link the application source in vector_copy.cpp
to create application binary called "vector_copy".
The file "vector_copy.hsaco" was created by the cloc.sh utility in the third commmand generated by the Makefile.
The Makefile calls the utility 'amdgpu-arch' to determine which gfx processor is running.
This value is used by cloc.sh to build an hsaco file for that GPU using the -mcpu option.
