Description:
When a continuation line is in a C preprocessor macro the parser fails 
and does not expand the macro before checking for sematic correctness.
If the file is preprocessed by cpp first, flang-new can compile it successfully.

Command:
flang-new -E swdev-416048.F90

Error:
error: Could not scan swdev-416048.F90
./swdev-416048.F90:3:16: error: Unmatched '('
    DECLARE_PARAM(a = &)
