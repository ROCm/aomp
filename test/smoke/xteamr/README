The xteamr smoke test executes a simulated reductions directly using the 
DeviceRTL xteam helper functions and compares to the existing OpenMP reduction.
It currently tests double, float and integer versions of dot, max, and min. 

This smoke test will fail if either the openmp reduction or the simulated reduction 
gets the wrong answer.  

The goal of this smoke test is to ensure that the DeviceRTL helper functions in Xteamr.cpp
are correct.
