This code implements the time integration of a three-dimensional
partial differential equation using the Fast Fourier Transform.

The code uses Fortran 90 module to specify data fields. So, a compiler
supports Fortran 90 is required.

Use VERSION=blk<n> to select a different blocking factor from
the default (32).
