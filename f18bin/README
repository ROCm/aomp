To get started with f18 development using the amd-fir-dev branch run these commands

mkdir -p $HOME/git/f18
cd $HOME/git/f18
git clone https://github.com/rocm-developer-tools/aomp
cd $HOME/git/f18/aomp
git checkout amd-stg-openmp
cd $HOME/git/f18/aomp/f18bin
./clone_f18.sh
./build_f18.sh


The repos needed for f18 will be in $HOME/git/f18
The build for f18 will be installed into $HOME/rocm/f18

To use f18 with AOMP fortran examples/tests, set these environment variables
   export AOMP=$HOME/rocm/f18
   export F18_FC=$AOMP/bin/f18.sh

             The f18 Driver Chain

Currently, there are three "drivers" for compiling with f18.
The first is the flang bash script located here:

   $HOME/git/f18/firdev-llvm-project/flang/tools/f18/flang.sh.in

This shell is installed in the compiler bin directory here:

   $HOME/rocm/f18/bin/flang

The flang shell script calls the 2nd driver, the f18 binary.
The f18 binary is compiled from:

   $HOME/git/f18/firdev-llvm-project/flang/tools/f18/f18.cpp

The f18 binary is compiled and installed here:

   $HOME/rocm/f18/bin/f18

In its current state, f18 executes the file pointed to by the
F18_FC environment variable. When you set F18_FC as described above,
the shell f18.sh will be called by the f18 binary. If not set,
the default value of F18_FC will attempt to call pgfortran.

The f18.sh script walks through the various phases of compilation.
It is a placeholder till a clang-style driver is completed
and added to f18.cpp.

The f18 driver train is:
"flang" shell calls "f18" binary calls "f18.sh".
If desired, one could avoid this chain of drivers
by calling f18.sh directly instead of flang.
There is help for f18.sh with "f18.sh -h".
